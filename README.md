- Setting up a javascript environment and webpage file structure
- Problem Solving and thinking like a programmer
- Javascript Basics
    - Strings and string manipulation
    - Declaring Variables
    - Operators and Conditionals
    - Function Basics
- Utilizing Chrome Developer Tools and the console
- Writing Clean Code

I started this project Oct. 26, 2025

## Post Project Analysis

Having completed the initial working version (commit 6), I am fairly happy with the results. One thing I found extremely helpful to getting started, and maintaining direction is I went, was begin with a commented text outline of each piece I needed to complete, the requirements listed as steps, and the bigger picture variables or functions I intended to use there. I don't think this was honed out enough to truly be 'Pseudocode', but as close to that approach as I could make. Being able to dedicate my focus to 'one chunk' or problem to resolve helps make consistent progress. This also helped me to work very linearly through the project, and be able to pause and come back without feeling lost (though it wasn't extended intervals at this point). 

I also found that there were many times where I knew what I wanted to do, but couldn't remember the exact syntax or name of a string method for example. Looking up these pieces was no issue, usually using MDN and that reinforced my recollection enough to move forward. I was very worried about 'not memorizing enough' but am feeling that this is less of an issue than I thought it would be. 

In some functions, I think I have a couple redundant or unnecessary lines (like assigning a new value to computerChoice or playerSelection variables), but I wanted to leave these in as written at least for now. Aside from the fact that it works, if I come back to review or update this project after more learning, I want to see what I was thinking at this time and only make changes with better understanding of why it can be modified. My current thought is that this would make it easier to pull those values should I choose to have them displayed on the webpage or with DOM manipulation later.
